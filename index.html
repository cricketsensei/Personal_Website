        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">My hobby is playing cricket, coding, looking at space and rocket launches, and reading. I love
            playing cricket. I have been playing it
            for 7 years. Cricket is a sport with a bat and ball which is just like baseball but a bit different. My next
            hobby is coding. Ever since I got to know that by coding you can make cool apps and make cool games, I
            wanted to be a coder. Just because of that I am in BYJU'S Future School. Reading is my last hobby. I love
            science fiction, fantasy, and adventure. Those three genres are very interesting and they are able to get me
            in the book as soon as I read a bit of the book and then I can't stop reading. I love the series Harry
            Potter. It is my favorite series. My second favorite series is The Land Of Stories. And my last of is Percy
            Jackson and the Olympians. Harry Potter is a story of this boy who is basically grows up to know that he is
            a wizard and then gets to fight the Dark Lord and his decendants and his supporters. He loses some close
            friends in the journey but then when Harry is seventeen he kills the Dark Lord and finishes all the bad
            spirits. Harry Potter is written by J.K Rowling. The Land of Stories is a series where a brother and sister
            lose their father at a young age and grow up to travel in the fairy tale world. They travel and fix things
            in the first book together and then in the second book the sister lives in the fairy tale world while the
            brother stays back in the human world. The Land Of Stories is written by Chris Colfer. And last the Percy
            Jackson and the Olympians series. It is about a boy who has ADHD and dyslexia. He is the son of Poseidon and
            Sally Jackson. He fights Hades and many other and falls in love with the daughter of his father's rival who
            is Athena. The daugther's name is Annabeth. Percy is also accompanied with Grover to fight against Hades.
